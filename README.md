# FARS-demos
Jupyter Notebook/R Demos Using FARS Data

This repo was created with dual purpose - to demonstrate basic exploratory analysis on the FARS data made available for this years National Transportation Data Challenge and to showcase some of the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook.

There are two scripts available, one written in R and one written in python. Both accomplish approximately the same data exploration, they're just there to demonstrate two of the many different pathways available for attacking this challenge. The notebook written in Python uses FARS 2015 data and the R script uses 2013 FARS data
